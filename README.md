# ðŸ©º MediGuide
## A Deep Learning based Alternate Medicine Recommendation System and SBERT-based intelligent medicine recommendation system.

## MediGuide helps identify alternative medicines based on their composition, chemical and action classes. It leverages both traditional deep learning (BiLSTM) and transformer-based (SBERT) models to semantically understand medicine properties and recommend substitutes. This can assist in medicine substitution, especially in cases of unavailability or cost sensitivity.
